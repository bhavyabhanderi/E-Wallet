Sure! If you're building a basic E-wallet project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you would typically need sections such as:

1. Account Info: Displaying balance, transactions, etc.
2. Add/Withdraw Money: Forms to interact with the wallet.
3. Transaction History: List of all past transactions.
4. Security: Adding features like PIN codes or password protection.
